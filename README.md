## Local testing

The project is divided into two parts, the server handles the backend and mongoDB access; and the client where the react frontend is implemented. To run the application locally, clone this repository and run `npm install` both in the main directory and in the client directory. Once the package installation is done, run `npm run dev` which will use [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) and run/watch for modifications in the client and the server simultaneously.

### Environment variables

- After creating a mongoDB cluster, assign the connection string to the variable `dbURI` in `.env` (create the file if not already present) of the main directory.

- You will also need to assign a value for the variable `jwtSecret` in `.env` which is needed by [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#readme) used for generating web tokens.

### To Update the heroku, run this command
`git push heroku master`
